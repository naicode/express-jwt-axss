# express-jwt-axss

[![Build](https://travis-ci.org/naicode/express-jwt-axss.png)](http://travis-ci.org/naicode/express-jwt-axss)

Middleware that validates JsonWebTokens and sets `req.user`.

This module lets you authenticate HTTP requests using JWT tokens in your Node.js
applications.  JWTs are typically used to protect API endpoints, and are
often issued using OpenID Connect.

## It's forked, whats different?

This module if forked form the  [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt) Module
made by @auth0. Followings points where changed:

  - deprecated `options.skip` was removed
  - if `credentialsRequired` is set to `false` a error is passed if credentials are passed but expired
  - the `options.getAntiXSSToken` Feature was added

The  `getAntiXSSToken` Option can be switched on by setting it to `true` or a `getToken(req)` function.
If it is set to `true` it will look for a second JWT in the `req.cookies.token` Cookie.
This second JWT is required to have a `refJit` Field containing the same unique identifier as
the first JWT in it's `jit` Field. This can be used to help against *simple* XSS Attacks if, and only
if the second JWT is provided in a way JS cannot reach on the Client. Mainly a Cookie with
the *HTTP-Only* and *Secure* Flag set.

Note that the `req.cookies` Field does only exists if a cookie parser is used.
With there for is a requirement if the `getAntiXSSToken` Feature is used.
